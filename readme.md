- Characters are both always falling down(gravity effect)unless they are on the floor or a platform  
- Both characters can be controlled at the same time
- Both characters must have their original spawn location on the floor
- Characters have collision detection
- There are platforms that also have collision detection and cannot be moved through, only landed on or bumped into from below
